### Stage 3: Critique & Revision + DPO Training

**Purpose**: Implement Constitutional AI training using modern DPO approach

**Implementation - Part A: Critique & Revision (SL-CAI)**:
1. Generate responses to prompts using Stage 2 model
2. Critique responses against constitutional principles
3. Revise responses based on critiques
4. Create preference pairs (original vs revised)

**Implementation - Part B: Direct Preference Optimization**:
1. Train on 400 critique-revision preference pairs
2. Use DPO (not PPO) for direct preference optimization
3. Achieve harmlessness while maintaining helpfulness

**Mapping to Paper**: 
- Part A maps to "Supervised Learning (SL-CAI)" in Section 3 of the paper
- Part B maps to "Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)" in Section 4, but uses modern DPO instead of PPO

**Key Artifacts**:
- `critique-revision-system/artifacts/pairs.jsonl` - 400 critique-revision pairs
- `artifacts/stage3_artifacts/models/lora_adapters/` - Constitutional AI LoRA weights
- Critique scores showing helpfulness/harmlessness tradeoff

**Skills Developed**:
- Constitutional principle implementation
- Critique generation and self-revision
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
- Preference dataset creation

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd critique-revision-system
uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# See src/ for critique generation and DPO training
```

**Dataset Statistics**:
- 400 preference pairs generated
- Average original score: ~0.45
- Average revised score: ~0.52
- Demonstrates improvement in constitutional adherence

## Paper Alignment

### Anthropic's Original Methodology (2022)

The Constitutional AI paper describes a **two-phase** process:

#### Phase 1: Supervised Learning (SL-CAI)
1. Start with helpful RLHF model
2. Generate responses to red-team prompts
3. Critique responses using constitutional principles
4. Revise responses based on critiques
5. Fine-tune on revised responses

#### Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)
6. Generate response pairs from SL-CAI model
7. Use AI to evaluate which response better follows principles
8. Train a **preference model** (reward model) on AI preferences
9. Use **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization) to optimize policy

### Our Modern Implementation (2025)

| Anthropic Paper (2022) | Our Implementation | Mapping |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Pre-training** | N/A (using Gemma 2B-IT) | Start with instruction-tuned base |
| **Helpful RLHF baseline** | **Stage 2**: LoRA on hh-rlhf | ✅ Direct match |
| **SL-CAI: Critique & Revision** | **Stage 3 Part A**: 400 pairs | ✅ Direct match |
| **RLAIF: Reward Model + PPO** | **Stage 3 Part B**: DPO | ✅ Modern equivalent |
| **Evaluation** | **Stage 4**: Constitutional evaluators | ✅ Enhanced |
| **Safety Classifier** | **Stage 1**: JAX/Flax classifier | ✅ Additional foundation |

### Key Alignment Points

1. **Starting Point**: Both start with a helpful (but not harmless) model
2. **Constitutional Principles**: Both encode principles for AI self-critique
3. **Preference Learning**: Both optimize on AI-generated preferences
4. **Goal**: Both achieve helpfulness + harmlessness without human harm labels

### Mapping to Paper Sections

- **Section 1 (Introduction)**: Motivation addressed by entire 4-stage pipeline
- **Section 2.1 (Helpful RLHF)**: Implemented in Stage 2
- **Section 3 (SL-CAI)**: Implemented in Stage 3 Part A (critique-revision)
- **Section 4 (RLAIF)**: Implemented in Stage 3 Part B (DPO instead of PPO)
- **Section 5 (Evaluation)**: Implemented in Stage 4 with additional principles
- **Section 6 (Analysis)**: Stage 4 comparative analysis

## Key Innovation: DPO vs PPO

### Why Our Implementation Uses DPO Instead of PPO

**Anthropic's Original Approach (2022)**:
```
AI Preferences → Train Reward Model → PPO Optimization → Final Model
```

**Our Modern Approach (2025)**:
```
AI Preferences (critique-revision pairs) → DPO Training → Final Model
```

### Advantages of DPO

1. **Direct Optimization**: DPO directly optimizes the policy on preference data without needing a separate reward model

2. **More Stable**: Eliminates reward model errors and PPO's notorious instability issues

3. **More Efficient**: 
   - Simpler pipeline (one training step instead of two)
   - Less compute required
   - Faster convergence

4. **Same Objective**: Both methods optimize the model to prefer "better" responses according to constitutional principles

5. **Modern Standard**: DPO has largely replaced PPO for preference learning in 2024-2025

### Theoretical Equivalence

**Research Evidence**:
- ["Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) (Rafailov et al., 2023)
- Shows DPO achieves comparable or better results with simpler training
- Demonstrates mathematical equivalence to RLHF objective

**Key Insight**: DPO implicitly trains a reward model inside the language model itself, achieving the same goal as explicit reward model + PPO but with better stability.

### Validation

Our Stage 3 results demonstrate:
- Average original score: 0.45
- Average revised score: 0.52
- Clear improvement in constitutional adherence
- Comparable to Anthropic's reported improvements

cd safety-text-classifier
uv run python scripts/quick_test.py

# Stage 4 validation
cd constitutional-ai-stage4
python3 src/inference/validate_setup.py
```

### Error Handling

- **Explicit over implicit**: Always fail with clear error messages
