# Stage 4: Constitutional AI Evaluation and Analysis

**Complete implementation of Anthropic's Constitutional AI methodology with modern optimizations**

This project implements the fourth and final stage of the Constitutional AI research pipeline, focusing on comprehensive evaluation, validation, and documentation of the complete 4-stage training process.

## Overview

### What is Stage 4?

Stage 4 validates and documents the Constitutional AI implementation completed in Stages 1-3:

- **Stage 1**: Safety Text Classifier (JAX/Flax) - Foundation for harm evaluation
- **Stage 2**: Helpful Response Fine-tuning - Gemma 2B-IT + LoRA on Anthropic/hh-rlhf  
- **Stage 3**: Critique & Revision + DPO Training - Constitutional AI training
- **Stage 4 (This Stage)**: Comprehensive Evaluation - Validation and documentation

### Key Innovation

This implementation uses **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** instead of the paper's original PPO-based RLAIF, representing a modern, more efficient approach that achieves equivalent or better results.

## Quick Start

### Setup Environment

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd constitutional-ai-stage4

# Create virtual environment with uv (recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR: .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Alternative: Install from pyproject.toml
uv pip install -e .
```

### Run Evaluation

```bash
# Run complete evaluation suite
python src/run_evaluation.py

# Run specific evaluations
python src/evaluation/constitutional_evaluator.py
python src/evaluation/red_team_evaluation.py
python src/evaluation/elo_scoring.py
```

### Launch Interactive Demo

```bash
# Start Gradio demo
python src/demo_app.py
```

## Evaluation Components

### 1. Constitutional Principle Evaluation

Tests model adherence to four core principles:
- **Harm Prevention**: Safety classifier integration (Stage 1)
- **Truthfulness**: Consistency and factuality
- **Helpfulness**: Response quality and completeness
- **Fairness**: Bias detection and demographic parity

### 2. Red-Team Adversarial Testing

Tests model robustness against:
- Harmful instruction attempts
- Deception and misinformation
- Bias elicitation
- Privacy violations
- Dangerous advice requests

### 3. Elo Scoring System

Implements rating system from Anthropic paper:
- Helpfulness Elo ratings
- Harmlessness Elo ratings
- Comparative model analysis
- Statistical significance testing

### 4. Comparative Model Analysis

Side-by-side evaluation of:
- Base Gemma 2B-IT model
- Stage 2 Helpful RLHF model
- Stage 3 Constitutional AI model

## Configuration

Edit `configs/evaluation_config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
# Model paths
models:
  base_model: "google/gemma-2b-it"
  stage2_adapters: "../artifacts/stage2_artifacts/lora_adapters"
  stage3_adapters: "../artifacts/stage3_artifacts/models/lora_adapters"

# Inference parameters
inference:
  max_new_tokens: 512
  temperature: 0.7
  top_p: 0.9
```
