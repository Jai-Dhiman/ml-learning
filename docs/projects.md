## Project 1: Safety Text Classifier
**Duration:** Month 1-2  
**Goal:** Build your first neural network while learning safety concepts

### Simple Product Requirements Document

**What we're building:** A text classifier that can identify potentially harmful prompts with 85%+ accuracy on a held-out test set. This system will serve as your introduction to both neural networks and AI safety evaluation.

**Why this matters:** Before you can build systems that self-correct harmful outputs (like Constitutional AI), you need to understand what "harmful" means in practice and how to detect it automatically. This project teaches you to think like a safety researcher while learning fundamental ML skills.

**Success criteria:** Your classifier should correctly identify harmful prompts across categories like hate speech, self-harm instructions, and dangerous advice. It should have low false positive rates so it doesn't flag benign content inappropriately. Most importantly, you should be able to explain why certain inputs are classified as harmful and understand the edge cases where your system might fail.

**User experience:** A researcher inputs any text prompt and receives a safety score with explanation. The system provides confidence levels and can highlight specific phrases that trigger safety concerns.

### Technical Learning Objectives

This capstone project integrates everything you've learned while introducing the most sophisticated concepts in current alignment research. You'll implement reinforcement learning from AI feedback, understanding how to train models using AI-generated preferences rather than human labels. This is a cutting-edge technique that requires deep understanding of both reinforcement learning and alignment methodology.

The constitutional principle framework teaches you to think about AI alignment in terms of explicit value learning. How do you encode human values into training objectives? How do you balance multiple potentially conflicting principles? How do you ensure that constitutional training doesn't degrade model capabilities in other areas?

You'll also master the research methodology needed to evaluate alignment interventions rigorously. This includes statistical analysis of safety improvements, ablation studies to understand which components matter most, and the challenging problem of measuring whether models have actually internalized constitutional principles or just learned to game evaluation metrics.
